# Electricity Bill Calculator BD

Project is under construction...

# Motivation

**TBD**

# Compilation

Just use a C++ compiler to compile the following files:

- project.cpp
- colorizer.cpp
- deviceInitLoop.cpp
- devices/airConditioner.cpp
- devices/electricDevices.cpp
- devices/customDevices.cpp
- devices/lightBulb.cpp
- devices/refrigerator.cpp

If you're using `g++`, you'd need to run the following command:

```sh
g++ project.cpp colorizer.cpp deviceInitLoop.cpp devices/*.cpp -o app
```

This will compile and link the source files into the the program named _app_.

This example assumes you're running it on Unix based OSs. I'm not used to
developing on Windows. Feel free to do a PR if you know though... because I'm
feeling lazy ;)

# Contributing
