# Electricity Bill Calculator BD

Project is under construction...

# Motivation

**TBD**

# Compilation

Just use a C++ compiler to compile all the C++ source files.

If you're using `g++`, you'd need to run the following command:

```sh
g++ *.cpp devices/*.cpp -o app
```

This will compile and link the source files into the the program named _app_.

This example assumes you're running it on Unix based OSs. I'm not used to
developing on Windows. Feel free to do a PR if you know though... because I'm
feeling lazy ;)

# Contributing

Feel free to contribute to the project if you want to. Just fork it, create a
branch, make your changes, and create a pull request.
